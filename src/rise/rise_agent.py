"""Single-agent variant: one LLM with three tools (bm25_search, bash, read).

Architecture: a single Agent loop with all the corpus access in one
conversation context — no orchestrator / sub-agent split. Compared to the
hierarchical setup, this preserves full evidence (no prose-truncation
boundary), uses prompt cache more effectively (one monotonically growing
conversation), and matches the BCP retrieval-agent / DCI bash-only baselines
more closely.

Mini-corpus mode is ACCUMULATE: each bm25_search hardlinks the union of its
top-k matches into the working dir without clearing prior entries. The
`bash` and `read` tools are both scoped to the working dir, so the agent
can only inspect docs that some search has retrieved this session.

Output dataclass mirrors the field set used by the runner script (so the
existing aggregation/judging machinery works).
